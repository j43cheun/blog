## Hello!

I'm Justin! I'm a software developer based in Redmond, WA, USA.

## Professional

I work full-time at Microsoft as a software engineer on the Storage and
Filesystems (SFS) team. My day-to-day work entails developing and maintaining
kernel mode and user mode components associated with the Storage Management
and Storage Spaces software stacks in Windows.

Prior to Microsoft, I interned as a software developer at various companies
including Nav Canada, IO Industries, Citigroup Inc., and IBM Canada Inc. These
internships were completed as part of the co-op program at the University of
Waterloo.

## Education
I graduated from the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, ON, Canada with a
Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Engineering in 2015.

## Hobbies
I enjoy biking, hiking, photography, watching movies, and playing video games
casually. In particular, I'm a huge fan of the main series Pok√©mon titles.

I also occasionally enjoy tinkering with iOS and web development during my spare
time.
