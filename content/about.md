## Hello!
My name is Justin Cheung. I'm a software developer based in Redmond, WA, USA.

## Professional

I work full-time at Microsoft as a software developer on the Storage and
Filesystems (SFS) team. My day-to-day work primarily entails developing and
maintaining components associated with the Storage Management and Software
Spaces software stacks in Windows.

Prior to Microsoft, I interned as a software developer/tester at various
companies including General Dynamics Canada, Nav Canada, IO Industries,
Citigroup Inc., and IBM Canada Inc. These internships were completed as
part of the co-op program at the University of Waterloo.

## Education
I graduated from the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, ON, Canada with a
Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Engineering in 2015.

## Hobbies
I enjoy biking, hiking, photography, watching movies, and playing video games
casually. In particular, I'm a huge fan of the main series Pok√©mon titles.

I also enjoy tinkering with iOS and web development from time to time. A couple
of the projects I've worked on and this website are the result of this hobby.

Here's a photo I took of English Bay in Vancouver, BC, Canada back in July 2019:
