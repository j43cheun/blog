Hi! I'm Justin. I'm a software developer based in Redmond, WA, USA. I'm
originally from Toronto, ON, Canada.

## Professional
I currently work full-time as a software developer on the Storage and
Filesystems Team at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, USA.

Prior to Microsoft, I interned at various companies as a software developer or
software tester. These companies include General Dynamics Canada, Nav Canada,
IO Industries, Citigroup Inc., and IBM Canada Inc. These internships were
completed in order to fulfill the co-operative education (co-op) requirements
for my degree at the University of Waterloo.

## Education
I graduated from the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, ON, Canada in 2015
with a Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Engineering.

## Hobbies
I enjoy biking, hiking, and photography. I also enjoy watching movies and
playing video games casually. I'm a huge fan of the main series Pok√©mon titles
in particular.

Lately, I've also been tinkering with iOS and web development during my spare
time...
