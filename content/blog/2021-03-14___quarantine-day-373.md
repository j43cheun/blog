Happy ðŸ¥§ Day!

It's been 373 days since I started my COVID-19 quarantine. I remember it like
it was yesterday.

At the start of 2020, I was in Markham, ON visiting my parents for the holidays.
I remember watching some news about an unknown virus spreading in Wuhan, China.
At the time, I thought nothing much of it. I was busy preparing for my university
classmate's wedding. I incorrectly assumed that like SARS, the spread would
mostly be localized to continental Asia.

About a week later, I returned to Redmond, WA for work. From then until March 6,
2020, I was mostly preoccupied dealing with some personal stuff and new feature
work. The stock market appeared to be doing very well. At work, I was drawing
dank memes about how the stock market would crash on the Surface Studio in the
office. The irony.

Two weeks before the start of March, it seemed like ðŸ’© was really starting to
hit the fan. COVID-19 had reached the US and was spreading in WA state. Within
two weeks, my workplace shutdown as a precautionary measure. We were to WFH until
at least the end of April. Evidently, it's March 14, 2021 now and I'm still WFH.

Things were chaotic from thereon. Hand sanitizer, Lysol wipes, masks, rubbing
alcohol, and toilet paper were sold out everywhere. Early on, the government
recommended against purchasing masks and to reserve supply for hospitals. So
when I went grocery shopping to stockpile on food and other supplies, I did not
wear a mask. Still, I was weary about becoming infected with COVID-19.

I recall that in mid-March 2020, there was a week and a half where I had nausea.
At one point, I woke up with cold sweats and felt like vomiting. Up until now, I
still don't know whether it was just the common cold or if I had a mild case of
COVID-19.

It's been just over a year since I started by COVID-19 quarantine. During that
time, I've mostly been shut in my 516 sqft apartment. Work has become life and
life has become work. I've also gained a bunch of weight from stress eating and
not being able to move around. Not really safe to go anywhere while COVID-19
pandemic is in effect. I'm an introvert by nature, but this is ridiculous.

Late 2020, the first vaccine for COVID-19 was finally approved. Since then, the
number of severe cases for COVID-19 appear to be dropping, as the most vulnerable
are innoculated against the virus. The US government said recently that there
should be enough vaccine for the rest of the US population by May 1, 2021.

Here's hoping that the pandemic is over by Summer 2021. I'd like to be able to
visit places again...
