Science Quiz 2007 is a very simple interactive science quiz program written in
the Turing programmimg language. The program uses imported JPEG images and WAV
audio files to test users on basic concepts from ecology and chemistry from
Grade 10 science. This program was written in order to satisfy the requirements
for the summative of the Computer Engineering Technology course I took in Grade
10. The program is poorly written and has a lot of duplicated code because at
the time, I wasn't aware that classes, functions, and loops were a thing ðŸ˜³.
